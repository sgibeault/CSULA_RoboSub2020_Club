The computer vision team will be responsible for writing python code to detect certain objects in a live video feed. This will require Python programming, possibly using a computer vision library such as OpenCV, Tensorflow, etc. to determine whether an object is in the vicinity of the sub. Writing computer vision algorithms from scratch is discouraged due to their complexity. Several common algorithms may be used and modified for the purposes of this project (SSD, RCNN, etc.). The computer vision system will detect objects and inform the mission planning state machine if there is an object of interest near the sub. The CV team will work closely with the mission planning team.
