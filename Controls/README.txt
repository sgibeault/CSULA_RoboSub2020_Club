The controls team will be responsible for designing a controller to control depth, optimize movement of the sub, and stabilize the sub to an angle about each axis. In the past, this code has been run directly on the Arduino that is responsible for the movement of the sub, but the code may also be written in Python and run on the motherboard. Additionally, our past subs have had utilized PID controllers, but the current senior design team will be exploring other controller options (LQR). The controls team may choose whichever controller and implementation method they see fit. The controls team will work with the navigation sensors team to interface the control code with the code that collects the data used by the controller and the code that sends movement signals to the thrusters.
