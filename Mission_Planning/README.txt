The mission planning team will be responsible for designing and programming the state machine that handles decision making and motion commands for the sub. The state machine will be programmed with Python and will use data from several other programs in the system. The states in the state machine will be based on the obstacles in the competition, and actions taken by the sub will be decided by the state machine based on the processed data from sensors. The state machine must handle only the high-level decision making, and there will be other nodes in the system that provide certain data based on other conditions in the system. The mission planning team will work with the navigation team, the stabilization team, and the computer vision team to interface all the sensors in the system using ROS.
