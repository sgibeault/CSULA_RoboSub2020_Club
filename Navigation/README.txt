The navigation team will be responsible for the electrical interface between all sensors required for navigation of the sub. The navigation team will create the electrical wiring diagram of the system, work on sensor programming to collect data for the stabilization team, and write the Arduino code that will send motor commands to the thrusters. In the past, this has been done exclusively using Arduino, but other microcontrollers may be used. The navigation team will work closely with the stabilization team to determine what signals get sent to the thrusters. The navigation team will also work with the power distribution team to provide them the necessary information to distribute power to each component in the system.
